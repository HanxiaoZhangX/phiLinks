* Chapter 12 - Enigma of Consciousness :noexport:

.  "A blank slate ..." Line 1. The blank slate (\_\_tabula rasa\_) is a
   phrase one often hears applied to Locke and his *Esaay Concerning
   Human Understanding", but as far as I know he didn't use the phrase,
   Aristotle did. Locke refers to a blank piece of paper. In any case,
   this seems an allusion to Empiricist philosophy.
.  "If the brain ceases ... nothing is left, not us ..." We have
   certainly seen a lot of evidence that the brain is central to
   consciousness, but have we seen anything to say that there is not
   more? Are we inferring absence from absence of evidence?
.  Review questions:

   -  Is it simply a matter of neurons?

      -  No. Poussin with this supposed cerebellar disorder lost more
         and did not lose consciousness.
      -  But recall that Copernicus was not conscious. Apparently the
         cerebrum is critical.

   -  Is the cerebellum an impassable sea? What is the evidence for a
      less connected neural structure? A nice article that talks about
      connectivity measures applied to various brain regions and
      developement is
      [[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223611000373][here]],
      and with a little bit of luck a
      [[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.379.2165&rep=rep1&type=pdf][pdf]].
      But I don't know of data that says it is less connected.
   -  Are afferent sensory systems necessary for consciousness?

      -  The answer in the book seems to be no, but that seems
         arguable. It might be that they are necessary at some point -
         initially - in development, but that they are no longer
         required. And while we may get along well without one or two,
         what if all were gone, what would happen to our conscioius
         state then?

   -  Are efferent arcs necessary?

      -  Apparently not. We have Mersenne communicating with his eye
         blink. And without that we might not know that he was in
         there, but he still could be as Owen's work with vegetative
         state patients seems to suggest.

   -  Is consciousness unitary?

      -  Apparently, that too, is just appearance or happenstance,
         because with the right kind of /disconnection/ we can be made
         multiple. This doesn't necessitate psychiatric illness, but
         could be related to callosotomy.

   -  The paradox of synchrony. Why is paradoxical?

      -  As we saw with seizures, when everything is "shouting" the
         same message then consciousness may be lost. Here the
         connectivity seems to allow for this unison, and therefore it
         is the paradox that connectedness is necessary for
         consciousness, and at the same time the route for its
         abolition.

.  Who is [[./pdf/workTuring.pdf][Alturi]]? There are long biographies,
   but this is a reminisence of personal collaboration.
.  What is all this staring at blank walls that is mentioned repeatedly
   in this chapter. I was wondering if he was driving at the
   [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganzfeld_effect][Ganzfeld]] effect?
   It was the discovery of
   [[http://www.gestalttheory.net/people/metzger.html][Wolfgang
   Metzger]].
.  Galileo's questions:

   1. Why the brain and not the liver? Why the cerebrum and not the
      cerebellum? Why here and not there?
   2. what determines what consciousness "is"?
   3. What gives consciousness its distinctive quality? See Stanford
      Encyclopedia
      [[http://stanford.library.usyd.edu.au/entries/qualia/][entry]] or
      this amusing entry by
      [[http://cogprints.org/254/1/quinqual.htm][Dennett]], which
      taught me the verb /to quine/ as to resolutely deny that which is
      real.

.  Photo on page 120 is of a Jaquard Loom. Those little punch cards are
   sometimes held to be the first programs, and a forerunner of what
   Lady Ada Lovelace used.
.  Alturi says: "...every such feat can be reduced to a series of
   simple steps..." as exemplified by this
   [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3keLeMwfHY][video]] of a working
   Turing machine.
.  Why the apple with the bite? Turing died from having bitten a
   cyanide laced apple. It is presumed to be suicide.
0. Contrast Frick's program with Alturi's? Frick wants to find the
   neural correlates of consciousness to explain it. Alturi wants to
   find the computational mechanisms to explain it? Do we need both? Is
   one approach more valuable than the other?

1. What is meant by the phrase, "... he [Alturi] had a smile on his face
   like an enigma."

   -  What does the word
      [[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/enigma][enigma]] mean?
   -  What was the
      [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine][enigma machine]]?
   -  What did it
      [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/EnigmaMachineLabeled.jpg]]
      like?
   -  How was Turing related to the

   -  Where can I see one? Kingston and Alberta each have one on display
      in museums.

2. Who is[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon]["S"?]] Claude
   Shannon; one of the great minds of all time.

   -  And tragically, what did he die from? Alzheimer's Disease.
   -  Here is a nice
      [[https://www2.bc.edu/~lewbel/Shannon.html][obiturary]] that links
      to photos of his juggling machines, and has a reference to his
      juggling theorem.

3. How do you quantify

   -  Shannon's Original
      [[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf][article]]

4. What is the origin of the word
   [[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/29/local/me-61253][bit]]?
5. Discussion questions:

   -  Is it reasonable to say that a human brain contains more
      information than a photodiode?
   -  Is Shannon's metric for information the only one available? Could
      be a good class scavanger hunt.

1. Tyndall from
   [[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24527/24527-h/24527-h.htm][Fragments
   of Science]] on the inability of every knowing the scientific basis
   of consciousness.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Granted that a definite thought, and a definite molecular action in
  the brain, occur simultaneously; we do not possess the intellectual
  organ, nor apparently any rudiment of the organ, which would enable us
  to pass, by a process of reasoning, from the one to the other. They
  appear together, but we do not know why. Were our minds and senses so
  expanded, strengthened, and illuminated, as to enable us to see and
  feel the very molecules of the brain; were we capable of following all
  their motions, all their groupings, all their electric discharges, if
  such there be; and were we intimately acquainted with the
  corresponding states of thought and feeling, we should be as far as
  ever from the solution of the problem, 'How are these physical
  processes connected with the facts of consciousness?' The chasm
  between the two classes of phenomena would still remain intellectually
  impassable. Let the consciousness of love, for example, be associated
  with a right-handed spiral motion of the molecules of the brain, and
  the consciousness of hate with a left-handed spiral motion. We should
  then know, when we love, that the motion is in one direction, and,
  when we hate, that the motion is in the other; but the WHY?' would
  remain as unanswerable as before.
