<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Who was Copernicus?
Copernicus had a stroke. Apparently awoke from a coma to view the pages of his book and then died peacefully. They identified his skeleton (not found until 2010) by matching DNA to hair from a book in a library in Sweden.</li>
<li>There is an important line here: "the universe was an orderly whole, in which displacing any part would disrupt the entire edifice." Why does it mean? Why is it important?</li>
<li>What is brain death?</li>
<li>Who was Wilder Penfield?</li>
<li>Why is he included here?</li>
<li>What was Penfield's theory of the brain and consciousness?</li>
<li>What is the Greek origin of the term Thalamus?

<li>What does "Functional Specialization" mean?</li>
<li>Where is the region of the brain specialized for detecting motion?</li>
<li>What is described by "Gallileo thought of the translucent mass, gutlike in its folds&#x2026;"</li>
<li>Key discussion question: is there a region of the brain for consciousness. Discuss Frick's condition. Evidence pro and con.</li>
<li>What is the term for the condition where people cannot recognize faces? 
Prosopagnosia.</li>
<li>"And yet his eyes were open, thought Galileo, and roamed within the orbits. Did any life revolve with them, did anything move inside? Did sparks of thought still stir?" What do you think?</li>

<li>Why is Nicolas Poussin included here do you think?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many of his themes relate to Ovid's Metamorphoses - which is the likely source for the Daphne episode above</li>

<li>Is a cerebellum <a href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/133/3/652">necessary</a> for consciousness? What has more neurons; the cerebrum or the cerebellum? Why might this be a problem for neural theories of consciousness that treat the neuron as the key information processing unit? See also below for neuron numbers.</li>
<li>The Hand Tremor Questions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is this a cerebellar tremor?</li>
<li>Or is it more likely an essential tremor?</li>
<li>Perhaps even Parkinson's?</li>
<li>Why does Tononi put it here?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What point is Frick making on page 39 when he speaks of the "cone's shape stays the same, though when we see it from different angles, the images formed onto our eyes are differently entirely."</li>
<li>Frick uses the word "invariants" on page 40. What does it mean?</li>
<li>Pause a moment to consider the contrast on page 41: "Copernicus was
gone, Poussin was painting." Why is this a puzzle? 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>100 billion cerebellum and 23 billion cerebrum.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why is the jester of the story on page 43 called Modulus?</li>
<li>Comment on the aptness of the two city story as a characterization of cerebellar and cerebral architectures.</li>
<li>There is another element to this story. What is the functional level at which to characterize a complex system? Is there any fundamental change between people in cells doing their jobs and well engineered machines doing the same things? Could we replace a few neurons with machines and leave consciousness unimpaired (<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/511466/microchip-restores-vision/">retinal transplants</a>; cochlear implants). How many replacements would be too many? Why can't we replace them all, at least in theory?</li>
<li>What does this article have to say about a cerebellar origin for Poussin's tremor?</li>
<li>The notions of "local interest" and "rapid adjustment" are characterized as remaining outside consciousness. Compare this to Fodor's notion of cognitive encapsulation.</li>

</ol></li>
<li>Who is Father P? Why Do you think so?
Part of the reason for including Pascal here may be his interest in free will and its role in human choice and salvation. This allows us to consider free will, and how it may impact on human choice, and consciousness. It is a trend in contemporary philosophy of mind to deny free will; to argue that it is an illusion.</li>
<li><p>
Are there problems with telling people they don't have free will?
Daniel Dennett thinks so. 
</p>

<p>
Might be worth taking a moment to read and discuss. Not Dennett is not actually talking about whether we have Free Will, but whether we should tell people. But do we have it? What are the neuroscientists <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-neuro-060909-153151">saying</a>?

What is the source and full quote from Valentine about her grandfather?
From the Count of Monte Cristo
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is true," said Valentine, as she passed the end of her slender
fingers through a small opening in the planks, and permitted
Maximilian to press his lips to them, "and you are a true and
faithful friend; but still you acted from motives of self-interest,
my dear Maximilian, for you well knew that from the moment in which
you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended
between us. You promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of
a brother. For I have no friend but yourself upon earth, who am
neglected and forgotten by my father, harassed and persecuted by my
mother-in-law, and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed
and speechless old man, whose withered hand can no longer press
mine, and who can speak to me with the eye alone, although there
still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor
grandchild. Oh, how bitter a fate is mine, to serve either as a
victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself, while my
only friend and supporter is a living corpse! Indeed, indeed,
Maximilian, I am very miserable, and if you love me it must be out
of pity.

.  Who is the man met at the beginning of this chapter? One can make a
   reasonable guess it is Descartes. He was in the military (although
   the family wanted him to be a lawyer/notary). He was often excused
   from his usual duties by people who recognized his "brain." His
   great philosophical insights were said to be begun while meditating
   in a heated room (oven/stove), and as a consequence of three vivid
   dreams. And, I guess it is obvious, he has a French accent.

.  "A blank slate &#x2026;" Line 1. The blank slate (\_\<sub>tabula</sub> rasa\_) is a
   phrase one often hears applied to Locke and his *Esaay Concerning
   Human Understanding", but as far as I know he didn't use the phrase,
   Aristotle did. Locke refers to a blank piece of paper. In any case,
   this seems an allusion to Empiricist philosophy.
.  "If the brain ceases &#x2026; nothing is left, not us &#x2026;" We have
   certainly seen a lot of evidence that the brain is central to
   consciousness, but have we seen anything to say that there is not
   more? Are we inferring absence from absence of evidence?
.  Review questions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is it simply a matter of neurons?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No. Poussin with this supposed cerebellar disorder lost more
and did not lose consciousness.</li>
<li>But recall that Copernicus was not conscious. Apparently the
cerebrum is critical.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Is the cerebellum an impassable sea? What is the evidence for a
less connected neural structure? A nice article that talks about
connectivity measures applied to various brain regions and
developement is
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223611000373">here</a>,
and with a little bit of luck a
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.379.2165&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">pdf</a>.
But I don't know of data that says it is less connected.</li>
<li>Are afferent sensory systems necessary for consciousness?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The answer in the book seems to be no, but that seems
arguable. It might be that they are necessary at some point -
initially - in development, but that they are no longer
required. And while we may get along well without one or two,
what if all were gone, what would happen to our conscioius
state then?</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Are efferent arcs necessary?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Apparently not. We have Mersenne communicating with his eye
blink. And without that we might not know that he was in
there, but he still could be as Owen's work with vegetative
state patients seems to suggest.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Is consciousness unitary?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Apparently, that too, is just appearance or happenstance,
because with the right kind of <i>disconnection</i> we can be made
multiple. This doesn't necessitate psychiatric illness, but
could be related to callosotomy.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The paradox of synchrony. Why is paradoxical?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As we saw with seizures, when everything is "shouting" the
same message then consciousness may be lost. Here the
connectivity seems to allow for this unison, and therefore it
is the paradox that connectedness is necessary for
consciousness, and at the same time the route for its
abolition.</li>
</ul></li>

<blockquote>
<p>
Granted that a definite thought, and a definite molecular action in
the brain, occur simultaneously; we do not possess the intellectual
organ, nor apparently any rudiment of the organ, which would enable us
to pass, by a process of reasoning, from the one to the other. They
appear together, but we do not know why. Were our minds and senses so
expanded, strengthened, and illuminated, as to enable us to see and
feel the very molecules of the brain; were we capable of following all
their motions, all their groupings, all their electric discharges, if
such there be; and were we intimately acquainted with the
corresponding states of thought and feeling, we should be as far as
ever from the solution of the problem, 'How are these physical
processes connected with the facts of consciousness?' The chasm
between the two classes of phenomena would still remain intellectually
impassable. Let the consciousness of love, for example, be associated
with a right-handed spiral motion of the molecules of the brain, and
the consciousness of hate with a left-handed spiral motion. We should
then know, when we love, that the motion is in one direction, and,
when we hate, that the motion is in the other; but the WHY?' would
remain as unanswerable as before.
