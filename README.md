# Phi - Links for Study

I use the book [Phi](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/216224/phi-by-giulio-tononi/9780307907219/) by Giulio Tononi
as a primary resource for teaching a class on the the neurology and neuroscience of higher order cognition admixed with
digressions on neural theories of consciousness. I find the book a very alluring entry into these topics, and it also provides
an exemplary demonstration of how to blend the humanities with the sciences; first, for the way literary and artistic
material reflects back on the scientific content to provide new routes to understanding and comprehension; and secondly 
for the way the scientific material can attract a new audience to aesthetic contemplation and bring new perspectives to bear
on the artistic content and meaning.

In order to enable such exploration and reading outside the primary source, I am accumulating a list of web links 
that can be used as a first step in exploring characters and content from the book and will hopefully entice students to
a deeper exploration of the science and the art. 

I have put this on github as a way to lure my students into learning the basics of git (forking, cloning, pulling and pushing). 
I hope that they will find new and useful links to share that can be incorporated with a pull request. 

As the preliminary hopefully makes clear these links are intended for the students in my course on a "Novel 
Introduction to the Neuroscience Consciousness" at the University of Waterloo (Psych 461 S2018). But if this repo induces
anyone else to read the book, I would be pleased, and if anyone else wants to modify or add links that they think would be
useful to other readers I am happy to entertain including them as a pull request. As I use [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) for my notes, please
make any changes to that file, and not the .html. Thanks.
