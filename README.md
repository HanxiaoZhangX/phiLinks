# Phi - Links for Study

I use the book [Phi](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/216224/phi-by-giulio-tononi/9780307907219/) by Giulio Tononi
as a primary resource for teaching a class on the the neurology and neuroscience of higher order cognition admixed with
digressions on neural theories of consciousness. I find the book a very alluring entry into these topics, and it also provides
an exemplary demonstration of how to blend the humanities with the sciences; first, for the way literary and artistic
material reflects back on the scientific content to provide new routes to understanding and comprehension; and secondly 
for the way the scientific material can attract a new audience to aesthetic contemplation and bring new perspectives to bear
on the artistic content and meaning.

In order to enable such exploration and reading outside the primary source, I am accumulating a list of web links  (the file: phiLinks.org) 
that can be used as a first step in exploring characters and content from the book and will hopefully entice students to
a deeper exploration of the science and the art. 


In a second file (the file: philQs.org) I list questions organized by chapter. Some of these are partial and fragmentary, because they are really just mnemonics to remind me of points I can raise. There are also some with partial answers or links to answers, but most of them don't have explicit answers. I just think they are good starting points for reviewing factual material or entering to more open ended discussions. I thought about whether to keep these hidden or not, but then decided that some students might find them useful for organizing their reading, and that if any other instructors decided to use this book the way I am doing then they might find these a useful starting point. Some are more biological and some more philosophical so all of them may not be of use to all readers or professors.


I have put this on github as a way to lure my students into learning the basics of git (forking, cloning, pulling and pushing). 
I hope that they will find new and useful links to share that can be incorporated with a pull request. 

As the preliminary hopefully makes clear these links are intended for the students in my course on a "Novel 
Introduction to the Neuroscience of Consciousness" at the University of Waterloo (Psych 461 S2018). But if this repo induces
anyone else to read the book, I would be pleased, and if anyone else wants to modify or add links that they think would be
useful to other readers I am happy to entertain including them as a pull request. As I use [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) for my notes, please make any changes to that file, and not the
html versions. If you update the org file in your own repo and wish to regenerate the html file to match you should be able to do this in plain vanilla emacs with the sequence of key commands C-c C-e h h (C-c means that you simultaneously depress the Ctrl key and the letter 'c' key).
